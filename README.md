# Reflected Recipes
![CoverImage](ReflectedRecipesCoverImage.png)

Reflected Recipes is a puzzle game played with the mouse. Your goal in each level is to make the two grids match.

In Reflected Recipes you play as a deity of creation, trying to assemble new worlds by rearranging their fundamental elements.  You've got a recipe book to follow, but unfortunately your vast power comes with a lack of control, and you sometimes modify the recipe itself while working. But hey, as long as your final result looks like the picture in the book, it's all fine, right?
